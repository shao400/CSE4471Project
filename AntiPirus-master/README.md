# AntiPirus
A lightweight scanning-only antivirus for python files, to determine if a subject python file is potentially malicious or not. 

Update: due to an error in updating my machine, the latest version of Antipirus was lost. This update is a remake of the original update, minus some features that I've forgotten since losing that file.
